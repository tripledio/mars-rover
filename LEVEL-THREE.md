# Level 3 Use cases

Now that we can drive around in our simulation, lets make it more interesting.
It's time that we remove the limit of one Rover. Let's allow up to 9 rovers. So that we can have Rovers with ids R1, R2, ..., R9
Having more rovers adds some more constraints and behaviour in our simulation. Because only one rover can occupy a spot at the same time, it is possible that
they collide. Therefore, we will need to introduce the notion of hit points. So a Rover can take damage and ultimately be rendered unusable.

## Hit points

+ A rover now has 5 hit points. When a Rover has Zero hit points left it becomes unusable and will no longer be able to process instructions. They are broken.
+ Two Rovers can not occupy the same space by driving. But when a Rover lands on top of another Rover they both occupy that location, And are both broken :-)

## Landing Multiple Rovers

+ We can land multiple rovers.
+ When a Rover is launched to the same location as another Rover, the launched Rover crashes on the existing Rover. They both receive 100 damage. Making both of
  them unusable.

## Driving multiple Rovers

+ A driving instruction sequence can be sent to multiple Rovers at the same time. [R1 f5 l b2 R4 b3 R2 l f2 R3 f2] is a valid command instructing four rovers to
  drive, in the order they appear in the sequence. Rover 1 will first execute its instructions, then Rover 4, Rover 2 and finally Rover 3.
+ When the state of the simulation is printed, it would be nice if the Rovers were shown sequentially by RoverId
+ When a Rover drives into another Rover, it doesn't take any damage, but comes to a full stop. It clears all other instructions and is ready to receive new
  instructions. The Rover that got hit however, does receive damage from one hit point

## Examples

### Landing Multiple Rovers

We should be able to land multiple Rovers in the Simulation. Below is an example of three Rovers landing properly, next to each other.

Landing another Rover on top of an existing one causes a crash. So after the example above, we land another rover on location 2 2.

```bash

Rover R4 crashed at [2,2]
Rover R2 received 100 points of damage

### Command multiple Rovers in one go by sending instructions in one sequence

Landing the same 4 rovers, letting one crash on top of the other. We can then send a single line instruction to the two still functioning Rovers. Letting them
bump into one another.

Here we land a rover in each corner, then let them switch places with a single line instruction, intentionally letting them bump into one another.
